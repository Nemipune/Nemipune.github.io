# This mah blog
I'm probably gonna try to write some stuff, interesting stuff I hope.  
Feedback is welcomed, as long as it's constructive.

Currently I'm too lazy to do any html/css and I refuse to use templates, sooo until I learn how to do certain things it's gonna be a bit bland

Also I don't have anything to really talk about right now...

The actual website is [here](https://nemipune.github.io/)
